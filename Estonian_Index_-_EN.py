create_paragraph('''Kanvas.ai Art Index is a tool for art investors.

Kanvas.ai's art index is a database created based on Estonian art auction sales \nhistory of the last 20 years (2001-2021), with an aim of making art and investing \nin art easier to understand for anyone interested.

The data has been collected based on the results of the public auctions of the \nmain galleries in Estonia, which provides an overview of how the art market \nbehaves over time and which art mediums and authors have the best investment \nperformance.

Based on the data, it is clear how the popularity of art has taken a big leap in \nrecent years, both in terms of prices and volume. For example, for many types of \nart work, the price increase or performance has been over 10% a year. Hence, a \nwell-chosen piece of art is a good choice to protect your money against inflation.

Kanvas.ai's Art Index currently does not include non-auction art information, but \nwe have a plan to start collecting data on NFT art media sold on the NFTKanvas.ai \npage as well.

The Art Index methodology is currently under development. Please email us info@kanvas.ai with any suggestions and comments.

Certainly, the replacement of the kroon with the euro plays a very important role, and more auction galleries have been added. Still, art sales have seen a significant jump since 2019, the biggest in 20 years. The last major change occurred due to the effects of the 2006-2009 economic crisis.
